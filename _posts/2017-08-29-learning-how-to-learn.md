For recent years, I was always wanted to learn new things. but it was not easy to get good at something.

I needed some tools help me learn something quickly. but I couldn't easily find these tools.

The only one thing that i could realize was that practice makes perfect.

Before several days, I found a interesting lecture about how to be good at learning, which is `Learning How to Learn` by Barb Oakley (on Coursera).
