I have been using Steemit for a while and I thought that i would like to create my own blog site using my Steemit posts.
I already know there are projects such as [SelfSteem](https://steemit.com/steemit/@almost-digital/introducing-selfsteem-a-self-hosted-steem-powered-blog), some WordPress plugins. but there is no project that make static blog what i want.
So I have started a small open source project this weekend.

[Steempages](https://github.com/appetizermonster/steempages) helps you to create your own Steemit blog.
You don't need to download the program, don't need any paid server hosting. Just make a few settings and you can create your own blog site.
The above figure is a blog I made using Steempages. You can check [the blog by clicking here](https://appetizermonster.github.io/blog)

To learn how to use Steempages, [Click here](https://github.com/appetizermonster/steempages)

How it works is simple. You create the blog using [Github Pages](https://pages.github.com/), and synchronize the Steemit posts using [Travis CI](https://travis-ci.org)

If you want to create your own blog site for free and with little effort, Try it out :)
Thanks!
